## Background

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of veterinary medicine heralds a transformative era, poised to redefine how animal healthcare is delivered. This evolution, however, is not without its challenges and risks. An article entitled "AI in vet tech: how can you address the risks?" available on Perplexity.ai, critically examines the potential pitfalls associated with AI integration in veterinary practice. The source emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations, data privacy, and the risk of over-reliance on AI systems, which can lead to diagnostic errors or reduced clinical judgment. It underscores the need for a balanced approach, combining AI's capabilities with human expertise to ensure optimal outcomes (Perplexity.ai).

As AI becomes more prevalent in veterinary practices, there is a pressing need for veterinarians to adapt to these technological advancements. This adaptation requires not only an understanding of AI tools but also a comprehensive upskilling in AgriTech. AgriTech, the application of technology in agriculture, offers innovative solutions that can enhance veterinary services through improved data collection, disease prediction, and livestock management. The convergence of AI and AgriTech is reshaping the veterinary landscape, necessitating a reevaluation of training programs for veterinarians to meet these emerging demands.

## Topic

One of the primary challenges in integrating AI within veterinary practice is the need for specialized training that bridges the gap between traditional veterinary skills and technological proficiency. Veterinarians must understand AI's application in diagnostics, treatment planning, and animal monitoring. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze vast datasets from wearable devices on livestock to detect health issues early, a task that would be time-consuming and less accurate if done manually. This requires veterinarians to develop skills in data interpretation and technology management.

Developments in AgriTech offer significant opportunities to enhance veterinary practice. Technologies such as drones for herd monitoring and sensors for real-time health tracking are becoming more accessible. These tools can lead to more precise veterinary care and improved animal welfare. For example, precision farming techniques allow for tailored interventions in livestock management, reducing the spread of diseases and improving productivity (Buller et al., 2021).

However, these advancements come with the challenge of ensuring data privacy and security, a concern highlighted in the Perplexity.ai article. Veterinarians must be equipped to handle sensitive data responsibly and ensure compliance with industry regulations. This requires a holistic approach to training that includes both technical skills and an understanding of ethical and legal considerations.

## Conclusion

Capacity building and training are crucial in equipping veterinarians with the necessary skills to leverage AI and AgriTech effectively. Comprehensive training programs can help veterinarians understand the intricacies of AI technologies, enabling them to integrate these tools into their practice safely and efficiently. By focusing on capacity building, veterinary professionals can enhance their ability to interpret data, manage technological tools, and maintain ethical standards in their practice (Redding et al., 2019). This proactive approach ensures that veterinarians are not only competent in traditional animal healthcare but also adept at navigating the complexities of modern AgriTech solutions.
